The focus of this project was to understand the correlation between climate change and spread of diseases like Malaria, Yellow Fever and leprosy. 
The data was accessed the API of:
1. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
2. World Health Organization
3. Google developers tables

The database was run on MongoDB and the visualizations were made with Mapbox. This website is not being hosted online however inorder to run this do the following:
1. Clone the repo locally
2. Using terminal navigate to to this cloned repo
3. Type into terminal "python3 app.py". This will generate an http link locally, copy the link and open it in browser
4. In a new terminal window type sudo mongod. this will prompt you to type password. Type the computer password. This will run the MongoDB database

Some screenshots of the website are as follows:

# How has climate change effected the spread of Malaria, Yellow Fever and Leprosy in the World

Does the expanding temperate zone (global warming) influence the occurrence of tropical diseases? These diseases historically have been isolated to specific latitudes. 

Approach:
Using historical data we will extract temperatures, latitudes, infection counts to determine if there is any correlation between the spread of diseases generally considered to be Tropical.
