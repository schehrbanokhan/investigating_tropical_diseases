# How has climate change effected the spread of Malaria, Yellow Fever and Leprosy in the World
Proposal:
Does the expanding temperate zone (global warming) influence the occurrence of tropical diseases? These diseases historically have been isolated to specific latitudes. 

Approach:
Using historical data we will extract temperatures, latitudes, infection counts to determine if there is any correlation between the spread of diseases generally considered to be Tropical.
